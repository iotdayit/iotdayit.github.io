    The IoT isn't a buzzword anymore. It is already here and it has been evolving since long time.
    A lot of companies have started to use more different technologies for developing the Internet of Things.
    Starting from the devices on the edge to the Cloud, containers are becoming predominant.
    They simplify software deployment and updtes to devices but at same time building complex architectures on the Cloud side.
    Thanks to containers orchestrator like Kubernetes and OpenShift, it is possible to develop high performant, scalable, fault tolerant and resilient IoT solution.
    During this day we will see a lot of technologies and examples already involved in the new IoT evolution!

    Software containers are getting more and more popular as a way to package and deploy software solutions, mostly for the cloud.
    Are the suitable also for relatively small devices?
    If you think that taking a technology that is born in the server space and applying it to resource-constrained devices doesn't make sense you should consider that the one of most popular OSs for embedded devices (Linux) is based on Unix that was designed to run on mainframes.
    Things can be adapted and adapting containers to run on devices may make sense in many scenarios.
    It also has some drawbacks and understanding when those exceed advantages is important to find the best solution for a specific problem.

    All the devices we use every day will be connected to the Internet in the next decade, from the everyday appliances, from the transport vehicles (car, bus, Metro, etc.) to the various industrial devices.
    Microsoft Azure Sphere is a solution for creating highly secure and connected MCU-connection devices.
    In This session are discussed the salient points and technologies that are the basis of this new solution.

    The new approach for emerging businesses is related to the way we consider our data, the big mass of data, to be stored in clusters and clouds. 
    But managing them with a new paradigm helps the digital transformation to be extended to the complete supply chain.
    The Digital Twins are the real jump forward in the connected industry.

    Containers could be the perfect medium for IoT Edge Deployments: in this scenario OpenShift is the right platform for helping developers to build Edge Applications. 
    We’ll see in a real use case scenario how developers may leverage OpenShift features for enabling Hybrid deployments on standalone Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 
    In the demonstration, we’ll also use OpenShift’s Ansible Service Broker for automating the external deployment, looking forward to use Ansible Tower when large scale ones will be needed.

    Digital Signage application are usually under considered applications.
    But with a small effort today we can build a complete platform for distributed digital signage that can manage different content on different places and devices, updating it in real time and supporting special functions like people counting, AD analysis, appreciation index etc.
    Let's see how we have designed and built such a type of system.
