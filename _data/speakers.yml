  position: Senior Developer & Consultant
  bio: |
    My passion for computer science began at the age of fourteen with the legendary ZX81 (endless hours of peek &amp; poke).

    During the 1990s, I developed applications using C/C++ and the various technologies on the market. 
    Since 2000 I have been developing with Microsoft .NET using both managed and native code to always achieve the maximum performance. 
    For several years I actively deal with embedded systems and, in particular, their integration with the "real" world.
