  position: Senior Developer & Consultant
  bio: |
    My passion for computer science began at the age of fourteen with the legendary ZX81 (endless hours of peek &amp; poke). 
    After finishing my studies I started my professional activity in the field of industrial automation and then i came to the world embedded in general. 
    During the 1990s, I developed applications using C/C++ and the various technologies on the market. 
    Since 2000 I have been developing with Microsoft .NET using both managed and native code to always achieve the maximum performance. 
    For several years I actively deal with embedded systems and, in particular, their integration with the "real" world. 
    Passionate and curious about everything that revolves around the IoT world both for hobby and work.
